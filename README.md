# openPortalAI

An Open AI Portal Framework Built Using Deterministic Pseudocode Prompting

## Overview

`openPortalAI` is a full-stack web application designed as a flexible framework for managing business portals, initially tailored for a utility billing company but adaptable for other industries like real estate or healthcare. The project provides a simple, user-friendly interface for authenticated users to access a dashboard, view placeholder data, and customize settings such as the background color, which persists across sessions via a backend API. Built with modern web technologies, this application serves as a foundation for future expansion with additional features and integrations.

The current version includes a login system, a basic dashboard with placeholder widgets, and a settings panel for toggling the background color. It focuses on core functionality and provides a stable base for adding more advanced features like data visualization, user profiles, or domain-specific tools.

## Features

- **User Authentication**:
  - Secure login with hardcoded credentials (`user`/`pass`).
  - Backend API endpoint (`/api/login`) for authentication.
  - Logout functionality to return to the login page.

- **Dashboard**:
  - A responsive grid layout with three widgets:
    - **Widget 1**: Placeholder for billing summary (e.g., "Placeholder data (e.g., billing summary)").
    - **Widget 2**: Placeholder for user stats (e.g., "More placeholder data (e.g., user stats)").
    - **Settings Widget**: Allows users to toggle the background color between white (`#ffffff`) and light blue (`#e0f7fa`).
  - Centralized logout button for easy navigation back to the login page.

- **Persistent Settings**:
  - Background color setting persists across sessions using a backend API (`/api/settings` GET/POST).
  - Temporary in-memory storage (`userSettings` object) simulates a database for settings.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Built with React-Bootstrap for a mobile-friendly, professional UI.
  - Widgets are displayed in a three-column layout that adjusts to screen size.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for creating RESTful APIs.
- **CORS**: Middleware to enable cross-origin requests between frontend and backend.
- **Dependencies** (installed but not fully utilized):
  - `mongoose`: For future MongoDB integration.
  - `dotenv`: For future environment variable management.

### Frontend
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **React-Bootstrap**: Bootstrap components for React, providing responsive UI elements.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for styling.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests to the backend.
- **React Scripts**: Create React App tooling for development and build processes.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v14.x or higher) and npm (v6.x or higher) installed on your system.
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code).
- Git for version control.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository** (or create a new project):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TorahDotOrg/openPortalAI.git
   cd openPortalAI
   ```
   If starting fresh, create the directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir openPortalAI
   cd openPortalAI
   mkdir backend frontend
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm init -y
     npm install express mongoose dotenv cors
     ```
   - Create `backend/index.js` with the server logic (see project files for content).

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     npx create-react-app .
     npm install axios react-bootstrap bootstrap
     ```
   - Clean up `src/` by removing unnecessary files and create or update the required files (see project files for content).

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend**:
   - In a terminal, navigate to the `backend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     node index.js
     ```
   - The backend server will run on `http://localhost:5000`. Test by visiting `http://localhost:5000/api/hello` to see a JSON response: `{"message": "Hello from the backend!"}`.

2. **Start the Frontend**:
   - In a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     npm start
     ```
   - The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000` and should automatically open in your default browser. If not, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` manually.

3. **Test the Application**:
   - On the login page, enter the credentials:
     - **Username**: `user`
     - **Password**: `pass`
   - Click "Login" to access the dashboard.
   - On the dashboard:
     - View the three widgets: "Widget 1" and "Widget 2" (placeholders), and "Settings" with a "Toggle Background Color" button.
     - Click the color toggle button to switch the background between white and light blue; this setting persists across sessions.
     - Click "Logout" to return to the login page.

## Usage

- **Login**: Use the hardcoded credentials (`user`/`pass`) to log in. The backend validates these credentials and returns a success response, allowing access to the dashboard.
- **Dashboard Navigation**:
  - The dashboard displays a simple layout with placeholder widgets for future data (e.g., billing summary, user stats).
  - The "Settings" widget allows customization of the background color, which is saved to the backend and persists across logins.
- **Logout**: Use the "Logout" button to return to the login page, clearing the session state.

## Future Enhancements

This project is a foundational framework with several opportunities for expansion:

- **Database Integration**: Replace the in-memory `userSettings` object with a MongoDB database using `mongoose` to store user settings and data.
- **Real Authentication**: Implement proper user authentication with JWT or OAuth, replacing the hardcoded credentials.
- **Dynamic Data**: Add real data to the widgets (e.g., billing summary, user stats) by integrating with APIs or a database.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Introduce a sidebar for navigation between different sections (e.g., billing, history, user profile).
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Data visualization with charts (e.g., using Chart.js).
  - User profiles with customizable settings.
  - Industry-specific features (e.g., billing calculations for utilities, property listings for real estate).
- **Security**: Address the 12 vulnerabilities identified in `npm audit` by manually updating packages (`nth-check`, `postcss`, `serialize-javascript`, etc.) as described in previous steps.

## Known Issues

- **Vulnerabilities**: The frontend has 12 known vulnerabilities (6 moderate, 6 high) in dependencies like `nth-check`, `postcss`, and `serialize-javascript`. These can be fixed by updating the affected packages:
  ```bash
  npm install nth-check@2.0.1
  npm install postcss@8.4.31
  npm install serialize-javascript@6.0.2
  npm install workbox-build@7.0.0 workbox-webpack-plugin@7.0.0
  npm install svgo@2.8.0
  ```
  Run `npm audit` after updates to verify resolution.

- **Hardcoded Credentials**: The login system uses hardcoded credentials (`user`/`pass`), which should be replaced with a secure authentication mechanism in production.

### Notes
- **Image Width Adjustment**: I replaced the Markdown image syntax (`![Aryeh Golob Contact](...)`) with an HTML `<img>` tag to set the `width` attribute to `50%`, reducing the image size by half as requested. This should make the image display at 50% of its original width in the GitHub `README.md` preview.
- **Raw URL**: I used the raw GitHub URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...`) instead of the blob URL, as it’s more reliable for rendering images in Markdown on GitHub.
- **Project Structure**: I kept the directory as `openPortalAI/` to match the GitHub repo, as noted previously.
- **Other Sections**: All other sections remain unchanged, preserving the project description, features, and setup instructions.

### Next Steps
- **Verify Display**: You can update your local `README.md` with this content and push it to GitHub to test the image size:
  ```bash
  echo '[Paste the above Markdown content]' > README.md
  git add README.md
  git commit -m "Update README.md to reduce contact image width by 50%"
  git push origin main
  ```
  If you need help with authentication (e.g., using a Personal Access Token), let me know!
- **Further Adjustments**: If the image still appears too wide or you want a different size (e.g., specific pixel width like `300px`), I can tweak the `width` attribute further.
- **Project Work**: If you’re ready to proceed with other tasks (e.g., fixing `npm audit` vulnerabilities, adding features, or syncing local files with the repo), let me know what’s next!
